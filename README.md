This is a short navigation game written entirely in Javascript. On running the game, the user is presented with a visual representation of a cave. They are given some short instructions on how to play and then asked whether they would like to escape or stay where they are. If a user decides to try and escape then the game begins and they are prompted to choose which direction they will move-in. The user must navigate their way through the cave while avoiding falling to their death or ending up in the dark unknown parts of the cave.

In order to play this game you must have Node installed on your device.

After downloading all of the files in this repository to a folder on your device, you should then navigate to the folder using your terminal. From there you can run `node main.js` to start the game.
